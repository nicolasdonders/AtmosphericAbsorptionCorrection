More details will be added here over time. Use this code to compute atmospheric absorption correction for sounding rockets in the X-ray range.

Options for pulling in UV-Vis cross-sections are in the code but will be refined easier switching. The code pulls in cross-section data from NIST (X-Ray) and MPI-Mainz (UV-Vis), atmospheric density from NRL MSISE-00 (N, N2, O, O2, He, H), and ground altitude based on GPS coordinates. Future updates will include the option for using the standard reference atmosphere, extending to IR spectral range (focus on H2O and CO2), switching optical path length calculation from observer to the sun and observer to ground, folding estimated spectral absorption into effective area (or bandpass filter) for image-based observation, and many more.

Output plot options include total absorption estimation for observation along flight path, specific absorption at specified altitudes, and more will be added upon request.

As with most projects, this effort is ongoing and public feedback is appreciated!
